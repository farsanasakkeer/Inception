## **Containers**
- **Containers** are like lightweight, portable boxes that can run an application along with everything it needs (like code, libraries, and settings).
- They share the operating system of the host machine but are isolated from each other and the host.
- They start up quickly and use fewer resources because they don’t need their own operating system.

### **Containers vs. Virtual Machines**

1. **Containers**:
   - **Size**: Smaller because they share the host OS.
   - **Speed**: Start and run quickly.
   - **Isolation**: Applications run in their own environments but share the same OS.
   - **Use**: Great for running multiple applications on the same host efficiently.

2. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
   - **Size**: Larger because each VM includes its own full operating system.
   - **Speed**: Slower to start because they need to boot up their own OS.
   - **Isolation**: Fully isolated with their own OS, making them heavier.
   - **Use**: Suitable for running different operating systems or when you need complete isolation from the host.


- **Containers** are like lightweight, efficient packages for applications that share the host’s OS.
- **VMs** are like separate computers with their own OS, which are heavier and slower to start. 

Containers are more efficient and faster but offer less isolation compared to VMs.
